## A list of things that had irritating friction involved.

Text mode:
1. Auto-fill mode should be default.
2. When using auto-fill-mode, should be more intelligent about bullet
   points and such. (Note: Org-mode does this right by default. Worth
   noting.)
3. Investigate possibility of just using org-mode for most text file
   things.

Haskell-mode:
1. Auto-indent for that seems to suck really hard. What's up with
   that? Fix it.

Writing modes:
1. Don't understand them. Rewrite one of the existing ones. Something
   simple to start with.
